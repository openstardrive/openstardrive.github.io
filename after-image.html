            <h1>After Image</h1>

            <h2>Synopsis</h2>
            <p class="synopsis">
                The crew participates in an experiment which goes wrong and creates a temporal rift.
                While fetching the supplies necessary to reverse the experiment, they encounter temporal anomalies including their future selves under attack by an alien vessel.
                Success depends on closing the rift, but whether they survive depends on whether they rescue themselves.

            <h2>Setting</h2>
            <div class="columns">
                <p>
                    This mission is written for a Star Trek setting.
                    It can be adapted for other similar settings by swapping out terms like "warp drive" and "phasers" for equivalents.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This mission is intended to be generic enough to run in any starship simulator,
                    but it references the <em>USS Odyssey</em> for convenience and in honor of the original version of the mission which ran in the late 1990's.
                </p>
                <div>
                    The names and places in this mission include:
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Captain Calypso</strong> - the captain of the <em>Fenris Sun</em></li>
                        <li><strong>Dr. Bates</strong> - the head scientist at the <em>Raza Array</em></li>
                        <li><strong><em>Fenris Sun</em></strong> - a cargo freighter with a crew of 12</li>

            <h2>Mission Briefing</h2>
            <div class="columns">
                <p>
                    The crew is being sent to the <em>Raza Array:</em> a science station orbiting a neutron star.
                    Their mission is to assist the head scientist, <strong>Dr. Bates</strong>, with an experiment which requires the help of a starship.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The <em>Raza Array</em> was built to study gravity and dark matter,
                    in an attempt to better understand the forces which hold the galaxies together in the known universe.
                </p>

                    <p class="sidebar-title">Real-World Science Connection</p>
                    <p>
                        What holds planets, stars, and galaxies together?
                        Gravity is the primary force we think is responsible.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We can measure gravity based on how much it changes the course of light, bending the path just like an optical lens.
                        Scientists use telescopes such as the Hubble Space Telescope or the Fermi Gamma-Ray Space Telescope
                        to measure the amount of bending and calculate the force of gravity.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        But as astronomers measure what's out there in the universe,
                        they have not found enough matter to account for the gravitational effects we observe.
                        We assume there must be something out there that accounts for this, and we call it <em>dark matter</em>.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Dark matter may account for as much as 85% of the matter in the universe.
                        Some gravitationally heavy things like black holes and neutron stars could help explain dark matter,
                        because they can be difficult to locate.
                        Or dark matter could be <em>non-baryonic</em>,
                        which means it is matter which does not interact with "regular" matter in the ways we are used to.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We still have much to learn about what makes up our universe.

                        Starting off the mission with some kind of launch or undocking sequence helps transition from training to the mission.
                        It also builds excitement for what is to come.

                    When the ship arrives at the <em>Raza Array</em>, they should be alerted to the high radiation levels emitted from the neutron star.
                    They need to raise their shields to stay safe.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The next order of business is to open a communication channel and (verbally) meet Dr. Bates.
                </p>
                <div class="sidebar dialog">
                    <p>
                        "Thank you for coming!
                        We are very excited to conduct this experiment.
                        If successful, we will get a precise measurement of how much the gravity of the nearby star bends high-energy emissions.
                        Then we'll use that data to make further calculations to determine how much dark matter exists in this sector.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        "But we cannot perform this experiment without your help.
                        We will be using a modified warp core to bend space in the area around the station.
                        Your ship's phasers and targeting systems are necessary to complete the experiment.
                        Once in position outside of our warp field, you'll just need to fire your phasers at the drone we've provided as a target.
                        Gravity should bend the phaser beam enough to miss the drone."

                    <p>
                        Dr. Bates will then instruct the crew how to perform the experiment.
                        At a minimum the steps will include:

                    <ol>
                        <li>Moving into position using thrusters</li>
                        <li>Locating the small targeting drone on sensors</li>
                        <li>Targeting and firing phasers at the drone</li>
                    </ol>

                <div class="sidebar tip">
                    <p class="sidebar-title">Getting the Crew Involved</p>
                    <p>
                        Depending on the details of your simulator and available crew positions, you can add additional steps to involve more of the crew.
                        Some examples:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Put extra power into phasers and/or shields</li>
                        <li>Engineering / damage control tasks to reinforce the ship systems</li>
                        <li>Modulate the shield frequency</li>
                        <li>Send a long range message reporting that the experiment is underway</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>
                
                <p>
                    The experiment appears to be running smoothly when suddenly there is an alarm on the station.
                    Dr. Bates cries out in dismay, telling someone else on the <em>Array</em> to "shut it down!"
                    A shockwave hits the <em>Odyssey</em>, causing minor damage.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Dr. Bates explains that the warp drive seems to have overloaded during the experiment.
                    The <em>Raza Array</em> does not have the supplies needed to make repairs and get the experiment going again,
                    so they are now sending a long range message to the nearby colony of New Avalon to order what they need.
                    The crew is tasked with traveling to the colony to pick up the supplies.
                </p>
            </div>

            <h3>A Distress Call</h3>
            <div class="scene-meta">
                <div class="mission-clock">00:30</div>
                <div class="duration">10 min</div>

                <p>
                    While en route to New Avalon, the crew receives a distress call from the <em>Fenris Sun</em>,
                    a light freighter which is under attack by an unknown vessel!
                </p>
                <p>
                    The signal is coming from a point very near by, but strangely there is no sign of the freighter or any other vessel.
                    Long range scans will locate the freighter several lightyears away, heading toward the point of the distress signal.
                    The captain should change course to intercept the freighter.

                    <p class="sidebar-title">Captain's Prerogative</p>
                    <p>
                        If the captain declines to change course, you can safely skip to the next scene.
                        However, the confusion around the freighter's distress call is one of the more overt clues
                        about the temporal anomalies which have begun.
                        Make sure to stress that something strange is going on.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <p>
                    As they get close to the freighter, sensors reveal that it is undamaged.
                    Still no other vessels are detected.
                    When they hail the ship, it's captain will answer: "This is Captain Calypso of the <em>Fenris Sun</em>. What can I do for you?"
                </p>
                <p>
                    The freighter captain will be very confused, telling the <em>Odyssey</em> crew that everything is fine
                    and that they have neither seen any unknown ships nor sent out any distress calls.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Since everything appears to be fine, the <em>Odyssey</em> crew should return to their task of getting supplies from New Avalon.

                        Around this point, the communications officer should receive the following long range message
                        from Dr. Bates at the <em>Raza Array</em> addressed to Starfleet Command, dated yesterday:

                        If this experiment goes well, I hope you will reconsider providing us a permanent
                        mid-sized vessel since our drones and shuttles are insufficient for this type of work.

                        Unlike with the distress signal, avoid calling <em>too</em> much attention to this strange event.
                        They need to notice it, but should not be told what (if anything) to do about it.
                        Little do they know that they are seeing their own future.
                        The crew is meant to be responsible for their own fate.

                        If you want, you can give them a second chance by jumping back to this scene
                        after they pick up the supplies from New Avalon.

                    <p>
                        Note that if they don't destroy the alien vessel, their mission will end in destruction.

                <p>
                    When they get close to the <em>Other Odyssey</em>, they will find an unidentified alien vessel firing attacking it.
                    (The alien vessel simply appears out of nowhere; it was not detectable previously due to the temporal anomaly.)
                    This alien ship will immediately turn on the newcomer <em>Odyssey</em>, opening fire without any provocation.

                    Any scans at this point will reveal that the <em>Other Odyssey</em> has been severely damaged and is unable to defend itself.
                    The alien vessel does not correspond to any known spacefaring species.
                    It is difficult to discern the technology of the ship, but it does appear to be damaged.
                    Any attempts to communicate will fail.

                <p>
                    In order to defend themselves, the crew must return fire.
                    After a short exchange, the attacker is destroyed.
                    The debris of the ship and the <em>Other Odyssey</em> then fade out of existence.

                <p>
                    With nothing else to do in this now empty bit of space, the crew should go get the repair supplies from New Avalon.

                    The captain should ask about obtaining the repair supplies for the <em>Raza Array</em>.
                    Yao will answer that the supplies are ready.

                        Getting the cargo on board is an opportunity to engage members of the crew with tasks to complete.
                        Depending on the capabilities of your simulator controls, here are some options of how to achieve this:

                        <li>Land the ship at a cargo loading platform.</li>
                        <li>A shuttle can ferry up the supplies from the surface.</li>
                        <li>Use a tractor beam to tow a cargo container.</li>
                        <li>Use transporters to beam the cargo on board.</li>

                        If the crew battled the alien vessel, they'll be able to confirm that the freighter was destroyed by the same ship
                        (the residual energy matches that vessel's energy weapons).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        But if they skipped that encounter, sensor scans can at least tell them that the ship was destroyed
                        by some kind of energy weapon unlike any known to the Federation.

                        If the captain chose not investigate the distress call during the earlier scene,
                        they won't know much about the freighter.
                        The ship's computer can tell them it was a cargo vessel with a crew of 12, commanded by Captain Calypso.

                    After a brief investigation, the crew should send a long range message to inform Starfleet Command
                    of the destruction of the <em>Fenris Sun</em>.
                    Then they need to get back to the <em>Raza Array</em>.

                    Dr. Bates will hail the <em>Odyssey</em> as soon as it arrives.

                        "We've got a big problem here!
                        Our experiment accidentally opened up a temporal rift.
                        This tear in the space-time continuum is disrupting the flow of time in this sector.
                        Things are happening before or after they should!
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        "If that weren't bad enough, a strange alien ship emerged from the rift and headed on a course toward New Avalon!
                        We've got to close this rift to restore time's natural flow before anything else slips through!"
                    </p>
                </div>
                <p>
                    The first priority is to deliver the supplies to the station.
                    Due to radiation from the neutron star, the <em>Odyssey</em> will have to dock with <em>Raza Station</em>.
                    Transporters and tractor beams are not options.
                </p>
                <p>
                    While repairs are underway, Dr. Bates will explain that they need to reverse the experiment to close the rift.
                    The <em>Odyssey</em> will perform the same steps as before, firing their phasers at the target drone,
                    while aboard the <em>Raza Array</em> they will invert the warp field.
                </p>
                <div class="sidebar tip">
                    <p class="sidebar-title">What's Going On?</p>
                    <p>
                        By this point, the crew has been given many hints that something strange has been going on.
                        Some of the clues have been overt (seeing their own ship on sensors!)
                        while others have been more subtle, like long range messages happening at the wrong times.
                        But they might not have connected the dots just yet.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This is the time to make sure that the crew understands what's been going on!
                        Conversation with Dr. Bates is a great way to accomplish this.
                        Have the doctor ask questions about what they've experienced,
                        and then highlight the connection back to the experiment and the rift they still haven't caught on.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        It's much more satisfying for the crew if they figure it out on their own,
                        so try to lead them into the realization.
                        But since they're heading toward the final scene, just tell them if necessary.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <p>
                    It only takes a couple minutes for the <em>Raza</em> engineers to install the repair supplies
                    (while Dr. Bates is talking with the crew).
                    Then it is time to conduct the reversed experiment.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The temporal rift successfully closes.

                    Now that space-time is repaired, there is one last task for the crew:
                    they need to find that alien vessel and prevent it from killing anyone else.

                <div class="sidebar tip">
                    <p class="sidebar-title">But We Already Destroyed the Alien Ship!</p>
                    <p>
                        If the crew has already destroyed the alien vessel, Dr. Bates will explain that due to the effects of the temporal rift
                        we cannot know <strong><em>when</em></strong> they destroyed it.
                        Therefore it is critical that they head to New Avalon immediately, in case they can still save some lives.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <p>
                    All indications point to the alien vessel heading to New Avalon
                    (the freighter debris and other <em>Odyssey</em> were along the way).
                    The crew should set course and head there at top speed.
                </p>
                <p>
                    They will intercept the alien vessel at the same location where sensors found the <em>Odyssey</em> earlier.
                    The unknown ship immediately launches an attack on the <em>Odyssey</em>, damaging their warp engines.
                    Attempts to return fire will damage the assailant, but not stop the punishing attack.
                    No matter what the crew does, their ship will be disabled.

                        After a brief exchange, the alien vessel is destroyed!

                        then the other <em>Odyssey</em> will pass right on by
                        (or perhaps engages the alien ship only to then flee, depending on what the crew did earlier).

                        Alone and defenseless, the <em>Odyssey</em> is destroyed.
